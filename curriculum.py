"""
This module defines a modular and extensible curriculum learning system.

It provides an abstract base class, `Curriculum`, which defines the interface
for any curriculum component. A concrete implementation, `LinearCurriculum`,
is also provided, which allows for the linear interpolation of a parameter
based on a given performance metric (e.g., success rate).

This design allows different aspects of the environment's difficulty
(e.g., success thresholds, penalty weights) to be controlled by separate,
independently configurable curriculum objects.
